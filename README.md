# MMBridge
MM Bridge is a module designed to improve the look of the new Money Moves discord bridge. The module is fully customizable using the settings menu /mmbridge. A detailed guide on using this feature can be found under the command /mmguide or below.
## Credits
- Inspiration taken from itqxic and his bagchat module
- Major credit goes towards Senither for developing the bridge and to Thundeee and Vigintillion for our implementation of it

Will probably support Rice Moves if and when they add a bridge.

### How to change the color scheme
Use the settings menu in /mmbridge. Detailed info can be found under the command /mmguide and you can see all color codes under /mmcolors.
