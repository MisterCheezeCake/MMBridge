# MMBridge

MM Bridge is a module designed to improve the look of the new Money Moves discord bridge.
You can always change the code to your liking if you don't like the color scheme I currently selected.

## Credits

- Inspiration taken from itqxic and his bagchat module
- Major credit goes towards Senither for developing the bridge and to Thundeee and Vigintillion for our implementation of it

Will probably support Rice Moves if and when they add a bridge.

### How to change the color scheme
